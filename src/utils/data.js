            \`\`\`Para
            In Python, variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated within a program. They serve as symbolic names (or identifiers) for values. Variables provide a way to label data with a descriptive name, making your code more readable and logical.

            Dynamic Typing
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Python is a dynamically typed language. This means you donâ€™t have to declare the type of a variable when you create one. The type is inferred from the value you assign to it.
            A variable's type can change at runtime, depending on the value assigned to it.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Code
            x = 5         # x is an integer
x = "Hello"   # Now, x is a string
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            In the above code, x starts as an integer (5), but when reassigned "Hello", it becomes a string. The type of x changes dynamically without any explicit type declaration.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Case Sensitivity
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Python variable names are case-sensitive, meaning Variable and variable are treated as two distinct variables.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Code
            variable = 10
Variable = 20
    
print(variable)  # Output: 10
print(Variable)  # Output: 20
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Here, variable and Variable are different identifiers, even though they have the same letters, due to case sensitivity.

            \`\`\`Bold
            Rules for Valid Variable Names:
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Variable names can contain letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Must start with a letter or an underscore.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Variable names cannot start with a digit.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., if, else, while, for, etc.).
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Example of Valid and Invalid Names:
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Code
            valid_name = "This is valid"
_valid_name2 = "This is also valid"
Invalid-Name = "This is invalid"  # Hyphen is not allowed
1variable = "This is invalid"  # Cannot start with a number
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Recommended Naming Conventions
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Use descriptive names that make the purpose of the variable clear.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Follow PEP8 guidelines for naming:
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Use lowercase letters with words separated by underscores (snake_case), especially for general-purpose variables.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            For constants, use uppercase letters separated by underscores (e.g., MAX_LENGTH).

            Memory Management in Python
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Python handles memory management automatically through two mechanisms.

            \`\`\`Bold
            Reference Counting
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Each object in Python maintains a reference count, i.e., the number of variables referencing it. When this count drops to zero (no references to the object), the object is removed from memory.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Code
            a = [1, 2, 3]   # List object referenced by 'a'
b = a           # 'b' is another reference to the same object
del a           # 'a' is deleted, but 'b' still references the object
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Garbage Collection
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Python has a garbage collector that looks for circular references and clears objects that are no longer accessible, thus freeing memory automatically.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Assigning Values to Variables:
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            You assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=).
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Code
            a = 5
b = 3.14
message = "Hello, World!"
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Here, a is assigned the value 5 (an integer), b is assigned 3.14 (a float), and message is assigned "Hello, World!" (a string).
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Multiple Assignment
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            You can assign multiple values to multiple variables in a single line.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Code
            a, b, c = 1, 2.5, "Python"
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            In this example, a gets the value 1 (integer), b gets 2.5 (float), and c gets "Python" (string).
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Swapping Variables
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Python allows easy swapping of variables without needing a temporary variable, thanks to tuple unpacking.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Code
x = 10
y = 20
    
            # Swap the values of x and y
            x, y = y, x
    
            print(x)  # Output: 20
            print(y)  # Output: 10
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Bold
            Reassigning Variables
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Variables in Python can be reassigned at any time, and the new value will overwrite the old one. The type of the variable can also change with reassignment.
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Code
            x = 10      # x is an integer
x = "Hello" # x is now a string
    
print(x)  # Output: Hello
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            In this example, x is first an integer, but then it is reassigned as a string. Python allows this flexibility due to its dynamic typing nature.

            \`\`\`Para
            Comments in Python are used to explain code, make it more readable, or to prevent the execution of certain lines of code. They are not executed by Python, and their purpose is purely for humans reading the code. Comments are crucial when writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code.

            \`\`\`Para
            Single-line comments start with a # symbol and extend to the end of the line. They are often used for brief explanations of a specific line or block of code.
            \`\`\`End

            2. Multi-line Comments
            \`\`\`End
    
            \`\`\`Para
            Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments like some other languages (e.g., /* ... */ in C). Instead, you can use multiple # symbols for each line or use a multi-line string (enclosed in triple quotes ''' or """). However, the latter is actually considered a string, and while it doesn't get executed, it is stored in memory if not used correctly. The more common practice is using multiple single-line comments.

            Relational operators (also known as comparison operators) are used in Python to compare two values or expressions. The result of a relational operation is a Boolean value, meaning it evaluates to either True or False.

            Exception handling allows you to deal with runtime errors in a controlled way, ensuring your program doesn't crash unexpectedly. Exceptions occur when something goes wrong during the execution of a program (e.g., trying to divide by zero or access a file that doesnâ€™t exist).

            Basic Structure of Exception Handling
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            In Python, exceptions are handled using the try-except block. You can add an optional else block that runs if no exception is raised, and a finally block to execute code no matter what happens (such as closing a file or releasing resources).
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Code
            try:
    # Attempt to open a file that doesn't exist
    file = open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found!")
else:
    # This block executes if no exception is raised
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
finally:
    # This block always executes, even if an exception occurs
    if 'file' in locals():
        file.close()
            \`\`\`End

            Commonly Used Exceptions in Python
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            FileNotFoundError: Raised when trying to access a file that does not exist.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            ZeroDivisionError: Raised when dividing by zero.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            ValueError: Raised when a function receives the correct type of argument but an inappropriate value.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            TypeError: Raised when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.

            Catching Multiple Exceptions
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            You can handle multiple exceptions by specifying different except blocks. This is useful when different types of errors might arise in a particular code block.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Code
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / number
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print(f"Result: {result}")

            \`\`\`Para
            When working with files, errors can frequently occur, such as trying to open a file that doesnâ€™t exist, or attempting to read from a file that cannot be accessed. Exception handling makes it easy to anticipate and handle these issues gracefully, so the program doesnâ€™t crash unexpectedly.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Bold
            Example: Safe File Handling with Exception Handling
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Code
            # Safely open and read from a file
try:
    with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file you're trying to open does not exist!")
    except IOError:
        print("Error: Could not read the file!")
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Bold
            In this example:
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            The program tries to open and read the file.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            If the file doesnâ€™t exist, it catches a FileNotFoundError and prints an error message.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            If thereâ€™s any other input/output error (IOError), it handles that too.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Bold
            Best Practices
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Use the with statement: Always use with for file handling to automatically close the file, even if an exception occurs.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Handle Specific Exceptions: Be as specific as possible when handling exceptions to ensure you're not catching unintended errors.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Always Close Resources: Use finally to ensure that external resources like files are always closed or released, even when an error occurs.
            \`\`\`End
            \`\`\`Para
            Test for Errors: Anticipate potential errors like file not found, permission issues, or invalid inputs, and handle them using try-except.
