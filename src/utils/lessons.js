Ironically, the first thing weâ€™re going to do is show how to tell a computer to ignore a part of a program. Text written in a program but not run by the computer is called a Preview: Docs Loading link description comment. Python interprets anything after a # as a comment.

        Comments can:
Provide context for why something is written the way it is:
        \`\`\`End
        \`\`\`Code
        # This variable will be used to count the number of times anyone tweets the word persnickety
persnickety_count = 0

        Help other people reading the code understand it faster:
        \`\`\`End

        # This code will calculate the likelihood that it will rain tomorrow
complicated_rain_calculation_for_tomorrow()

        Ignore a line of code and see how a program will run without it:

        This is the second lesson. Here we will discuss more advanced topics.
        \`\`\`End

        Advanced topics include:
        \`\`\`End
        \`\`\`Code
        # Example of advanced code
        advanced_example = "This is an advanced example"

        Understanding these topics will help you become a better programmer.
